## HeLx Application Registry
##  
##   The registry consolidates metadata links to application specifications.
##   The registry's main components are:
##     * Metadata about the registry itself
##     * Repositories describing sources of application metadata.
##     * Sub-Registries providing contexts for sets of applications.
##
##   Each application has an identifier, name, description, and a link to its 
##   specification. Applications may currently be specified in the 
##   docker-compose format though we also expect to broaden the scope of 
##   apps to include launching websites and other methods.
##
##   When a platform launches an application, it needs to know what endpoints
##   to present upstream. Apps can also specify a map of service names to port
##   numbers. The service and port name must match the name of a container
##   in the docker-compose specification and its exposed port respectively.
##
##   Contexts implement a simple form of inheritance. Each context may speicify
##   a list of contexts it extends. Apps from extended contexts will be added
##   to the extending context's apps.
##
##   This is alpha. Expect significant changes to modularity, inheritance,
##   and naming coming soon.
##
##   Next steps:
##     * Requirements: allow apps to specify that they require services including
##        - A back end service like a database, spark, dicom api, etc.
##        - A storage device like a pvc with a particular name or configuration.
##     * Compilation: Compile the registry verifying
##        - All required elements are either provided explicitly or can be
##          inferred.
##        - That designated network resources exist (200 http status).
##        - That the docker-compose file is syntactically valid.
##        - That the service name to export is in the docker-compose file and
##          that one is specified.
##     * Semantic annotation: Annotate apps with the Biolink model and EDAM
##        ontology to enable semantic search.
